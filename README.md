# HyConsole
HyConsole is a way to get data on players and leaderboards from the Hypixel Minecraft server from the command line. 
Keep in mind I have no affiliation with the Hypixel Server

you will need the python packages Requests, and Pytermgui for this to work

installation:
  work in progress
  
 syntax: if you have it as an executeable and it is not on PATH, you will use ./HyConsole
 
 It will ask for your hypixel api key which you can get by going on the hypixel server and running the command /api new, then it will ask for a username, input the username of the player you want to view. the playername is required so if you arent looking at stats of a player you can just put in a random name or your own.
