# HyConsole
HyConsole is a way to get data on players and leaderboards from the Hypixel Minecraft server from the command line. 
Keep in mind I have no affiliation with the Hypixel Server

installation:
  work in progress
  
 syntax: if you have it as an executeable and it is not on PATH, you will use ./HyConsole, then use one of various arguments
 
 Currently there is a gui that can be navigated but does not have full functionality yet
