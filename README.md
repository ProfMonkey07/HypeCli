# HyConsole
HyConsole is a way to get data on players and leaderboards from the Hypixel Minecraft server from the command line. 
Keep in mind I have no affiliation with the Hypixel Server

you will need the python packages Requests, and Pytermgui for this to work

installation:
  work in progress
  
 syntax: if you have it as an executeable and it is not on PATH, you will use ./HyConsole, then use one of various arguments
 
 Currently there is a gui that can be navigated but does not have full functionality yet
 
 it needs a playername to work, the syntax is ./HyConsole -p <playername> if made executeable, if added to path it is HyConsole -p <playername>, and if it has not been made executeable, python3 HyConsole -p <playername>
